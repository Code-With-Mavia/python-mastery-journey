**Task:** Print the length of the tuple.

---

#### Problem 2: Access First Element  
**Input:** `colors = ("red", "green", "blue")`  
**Task:** Print the first element.

---

#### Problem 3: Access Last Element  
**Input:** `fruits = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")`  
**Task:** Print the last element.

---

#### Problem 4: Check Membership  
**Input:**  
```python
pets = ("dog", "cat", "rabbit")
pet = "cat"
````

**Task:** Print `"Found"` if `pet` is in the tuple; otherwise, print `"Not Found"`.

---

#### Problem 5: Tuple Concatenation

**Input:**

```python
t1 = (1, 2, 3)
t2 = (4, 5)

**Task:** Concatenate the two tuples and print the result.

---

### ðŸŸ¡ Intermediate

---

#### Problem 6: Find Index

**Input:**

```python
letters = ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd')
char = 'c'
```

**Task:** Print the index of `char` in the tuple.

---

#### Problem 7: Count Occurrences

**Input:**

```python
nums = (1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 2)
num = 2
```

**Task:** Print how many times `num` appears in the tuple.

---

#### Problem 8: Tuple Slicing

**Input:** A tuple of integers.
**Task:** Print the first three elements using slicing.

---

#### Problem 9: Check Empty Tuple

**Input:** A tuple that may be empty or not.
**Task:** Print `"Empty"` if the tuple has no elements; otherwise, print `"Not Empty"`.

---

#### Problem 10: Compare Tuples

**Input:** Two tuples.
**Task:** Print `"Equal"` if both tuples have the same elements in the same order; else print `"Not Equal"`.

---

### ðŸ”´ Advanced

---

#### Problem 11: Nested Tuple Access

**Input:** A tuple containing other tuples, e.g., `nested = ((1,2), (3,4), (5,6))`
**Task:** Print the second element of the third inner tuple.

---

#### Problem 12: Convert Tuple to List and Check

**Input:** A tuple of integers.
**Task:** Convert the tuple to a list and print the list.

---

#### Problem 13: Tuple Repetition

**Input:** A tuple and an integer `n`.
**Task:** Print the tuple repeated `n` times (e.g., `(1,2)*3` â†’ `(1,2,1,2,1,2)`).

---

#### Problem 14: Tuple Unpacking

**Input:** A tuple of three elements.
**Task:** Assign each element to separate variables and print them.

---

#### Problem 15: Tuple Contains All Elements

**Input:** Two tuples.
**Task:** Print `"Yes"` if the first tuple contains all elements of the second tuple; else `"No"`.
